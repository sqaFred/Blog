Hello!

Please find my test plan and bug report for CRUD functionality in this repository as <a href="https://github.com/sqaFred/Blog/raw/main/CRUD%20Test%20cases%20and%20Bug%20report.xlsx">CRUD Test cases and Bug report.xlsx</a> you can also find the same table at <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17gvVybbXW8bkeYYLsM81caBCcFQtFRjEb-yZ6yK6xxE/edit?usp=sharing">google.sheets</a>. Since there were no documentation and requirements I assumed them from my own engineering perspective. Due to time limitation I didn't perform a cross-browseer and cross-platform testing but would do it on a real project.
<p>
During exploratory testing I've discovered several bugs out of my main focus, including some minor GUI bugs, they are listed below CRUD functionality.
<p>
I was trying to implement automation using PyCharm + Selenium but wasn't able to go through your network login. So instead I was using TestComplete from Smartbear.
I assume that all my current test cases might be automated, some automated test cases you can find <a href="https://github.com/sqaFred/Blog/raw/main/Bblog.zip">here<a/>
<p>
Hope to get in touch with you soon!
